# HSS Automation
 
 C/C++ code for use on a pre-designed ATMEGA168 board. The program 
 is to be used with sensors that can detect faults in a Yardmaster
 Separator and trigger relays which will shutdown the machine. 

Also contains programs for copying the EEPROM memory of a Controller 
to another ATMEGA board configured as a peripheral.
